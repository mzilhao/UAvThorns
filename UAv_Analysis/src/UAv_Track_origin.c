  NOTES:
  - If we want to go more general than fixed coordinates or tracking from a grid scalar,
  maybe we could have a UAv_Set_origin() function, that would call or incorporate this one.
  - It could be tempting to just set the x0, y0, z0 pointers to the corresponding variables,
  at Initialization [though we would need to be really sure that the pointers don't change
  during a simulation, in any case]. However, these are const pointers, so actually they're
  read-only, we can't set them. This function takes a negligible time anyway.
